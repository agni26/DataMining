Predicting Survival on the Titanic: Analysis Using Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification Models

•	Developed machine learning models for binary classification and achieved 89.6% accuracy in predicting the survival rate of Titanic passengers.
•	Trained Random Forest and Decision Tree models to achieve final results. I also experimented with Gradient Boosted Tree, Naïve Bayes and KNN.
